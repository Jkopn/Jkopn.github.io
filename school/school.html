I am a recent graduate from Western Governors University with a Bachelor of Science in Software Development! <br>
I also have Associates degrees in Software Engineering and Electronics. <br>
I started down the electronics path for School mostly for my father. <br>
In the process, I found that I just did not love electronics. <br>
So, I finished the Associates in Electronics and moved on to Software Engineering which I do love. <br>
I still use Electronics at work and like it for a Hobby. <br>
